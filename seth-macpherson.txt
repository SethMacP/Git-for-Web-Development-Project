1. What is Semantic HTML?

3. What is an attribute and where do we put it?

7. What is an id? 
	A more specific class, should only be used once.
    
8. What elements can I add an id to? 
	div, section, header, footer, nav, etc.
   
 9. How many times can I use the same id on a page? 
	If this is exclusively HTML/CSS it *can* be used more than once, but it absolutely shouldn't be. We had an example in lecture where it worked. It's bad coding practice, though.
    
10. What is a class? 
	The less specific version of 'id'. It groups together whatever you apply it to.
    
11. What elements can I add a class to? 
	The same as ID
    
12. How many times can I use the same class on a page? 
	As many times as you want to!
    
13. How do I get my link to open in a new tab?
	Add a _blank as the target in the <a> tag. However you can't specify that this is a new tab vs. new window. That is up to the user & their settings.
    
14. What is the alt attribute in the image tag used for? 
	Mostly for screenreaders, but the information is there to inform you incase the photo doesn't load.
    
15. How do I reference an id?
	#id_name in css / <div id="id_name"> in html
    
16. What is the difference between a section and a div
	A div isn't really all that semantic whereas a section provides much more meaning. Sections will typically have a h2-h6 accompanying it and containt text/outline other information.

19. What is the difference between a class and an id? - Give me an example of when I might use each one
	id: userID - There should be only one seth-macpherson that get's my grades.
	class: webpt22 - When we receive updates about our 'class' everyone should be notified.

	I understand id/class are css selectors, but metaphors are easy.
   
 20. How do we select classes in CSS?
	A period is put before the classes name (ie: .className)
   
 21. How do we select a p element with a single class of “human””?
	.human p {attributes: here;}
   
 22. What is a parent child selector? When would this be useful? 
	Useful: Navigation menus sometimes have dropdown menus. Not all of the links will have this and so they wont need the code.
	Parent/Child selectors let you work your way through the code to select very specific parts. I want all 3 divs going down my page to have red text, but I want the first one to have a black background.
	
   
 23. How do you select all links within a div with the class of sidebar?
	.sidebar div a { }

Stretch Questions

    
1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
	A block element likes to shove it's elbows out and push everything out of its way, an inline element will sit within the content that is there.
    
2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
	It's positioned closest to its ancestor, no matter what. 
   
3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
	min-width: if the content is smaller than this, it will be applied; otherwise no effect.
    
4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
	Display block default: address, article
	display inline default: map, output
	inline-block default: img (only one?)
    
5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 

	Content: What you are actually modifying with the following:
	Margin Distance from your border to other content
	Padding: Distance from your content to the border
	Border : Distance from Margin and padding

OTHER CONTENT | Margin | Border | Padding | Content | Padding | Border | Margin| OTHER CONTENT
(Repeat for up and down)
